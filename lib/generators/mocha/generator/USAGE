Description:
    This generator is here to help you scaffold a very basic mocha test suite
    for a given generator, using yeoman-generators helpers.

    Give it additional arguments as filepath to check, and the correspoding
    assertions will be generated for you.

Example:
    yeoman init mocha:generator Thing

    This will create:
        test/generators/test-thing.js

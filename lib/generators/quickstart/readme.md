usage:    yeoman init quickstart

'quickstart' represents the most basic type of application
scaffold that you could generate using our generator system.
It basically provides a version of what is created when you
`yeoman init`, but only contains HTML5 Boilerplate, jQuery,
Modernizr and Mocha for testing.

The idea behind this scaffold is that it provides users a super
quick way to start projects if they don't wish to go through the
`yeoman init` prompts, but also provides generator authors a base
that they can expand on for generators of their own.

'quickstart' does not use the prompts API, which we recommend if you
wish to create a generator which is more customizable. If you wish
to create a generator that just copies an existing boilerplate
structure, this is probably the best reference point to use.

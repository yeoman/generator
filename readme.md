## Getting Started

If you're interested in writing your own Yeoman generator we recommend reading the official [documentation](http://yeoman.io/generators.html). 

There are typically two types of generators - simple boilerplate 'copiers' and more advanced generators which can use custom prompts, remote dependencies, wiring and much more.

The docs cover how to create generators from scratch as well as recommending command-line generators for making other generators.

## Testing generators

There is currently no formal infrastructure for testing generators, however you may find our [mocha generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-mocha) for custom generators useful.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in writing your own Yeoman generator we recommend first
checking out any of our current generators. There are typically
two types of generators - simple boilerplate 'copiers' and more advanced generators
which can use custom prompts, remote dependencies and can do a lot more.

Read about the capabilities of our generators in our
[docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Generators). This guide will also cover how to create a new generator template using the command-line.


## Testing generators

There is currently no formal infrastructure for testing generators, however you may find our [mocha generator](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Testing-generators) for custom generators useful.

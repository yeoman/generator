# Yeoman Generators

Rails-like Generators for Yeoman that provide scaffolding for your apps.

## Getting started

If you're interested in writing your own Yeoman generator we recommend first
checking out two of the sample generators in this repository. There are typically
two types of generators - simple boilerplate 'copiers' and more advanced generators
which can use custom prompts, remote dependencies and can do a lot more.

* quickstart - a basic boilerplate generator with jQuery, Modernizr and HTML5 Boilerplate
* yeoman - the default yeoman generator, which includes prompts and more advanced capabilities.

Read about the capabilities of our generators in our [docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/docs/cli/generators.md).
